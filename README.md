# MCP
Model Context Protocol = Connecting agents to data sources such as databases or API'S
MCP = Consists of a Host, Client and Server 
Like a brain working memory for the API.

. Identify the API calls or endpoints for each module.
Sensor/audio access: The robot has cameras/mics/speakers for sensing and TTS

FastAPI project: Define endpoints (e.g. /get_sensor_data, /move_joint) that will, in their handlers, communicate with Ameca via the Tritium interface.

MCP Protocol Fundamentals
(MCP) is an open standard to connect AI systems with external data sources

. Designed for two-way communication between clients (AI assistants or tools) and servers (data sources) 

. In MCP architecture, a developer can either expose data by building an MCP server for a given source (e.g. a database or API), or create an MCP client (an AI tool) that connects to existing servers. The protocol replaces ad-hoc integrations with JSON-RPC messages, so any client and server speaking MCP can interoperate. The key points: MCP defines a standard way for a client (like our FastAPI service) to request data from a server (which could be our Tritium/Ameca interface), and vice versa

. Our client will both send requests (e.g. “get joint angles”) and possibly receive commands from the agent.
Client vs Server: Decide which role we play. Likely our FastAPI app will be an MCP server for Ameca data (exposing sensor feeds, state) and an MCP client to any AI agent. Study examples (e.g. MCP servers for GitHub or Postgres) for guidance.
Integrating Ameca via FastAPI (AMI Client)

With the above in place, we can implement the AMI (Ameca interface) as an MCP client using FastAPI. Essentially, our FastAPI application will expose HTTP endpoints that translate into Ameca API calls. For example, a FastAPI route /motion could trigger joint movements on Ameca by calling Tritium’s script endpoints. 

Potential Approach:

Tritium’s Python scripting API: the FastAPI handler makes a request to Tritium (for instance, invoking a specific script via a POST to /start_script) and returns the result. The FastAPI app must also accept MCP messages (JSON-RPC) from the AI agent and forward them appropriately. As a Python-based client, FastAPI can leverage Tritium’s Python support

In summary, our integration steps are: authenticate with the Tritium robot OS, call its API in Python (via REST or WebSocket), and wrap those calls in FastAPI endpoints that conform to the MCP schema. Successful integration will satisfy “Ameca API has been thoroughly researched and tested” by demonstrating actual data exchange between the robot and external systems.

MCP Client: Implement the MCP JSON-RPC client logic in Python. Use FastAPI to receive MCP-formatted requests, then translate and dispatch them to Ameca/Tritium.

API Calls: If Tritium provides REST or HTTP APIs (e.g. to start scripts or fetch status), call these from Python. Otherwise, use the WebRTC peer or direct Python scripting on the robot.

Testing: Write test scripts to ping each Ameca API and ensure the FastAPI endpoint returns the expected response. Verify that these endpoints can be called via MCP from an agent.

Authentication: Ensure the FastAPI server handles any needed auth tokens for both the Tritium robot and for MCP (if MCP sessions require keys).
